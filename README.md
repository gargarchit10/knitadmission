In this project i have 
Studied last 5 year admission results of an engineering college and then
applied various supervised and unsupervised data mining algorithms to predict next
year student admission decision i.e which branch they will opt for by JEE mains score
and 12th percentage through R . Also , a basic website was designed which contained
a form for students who were interested in joining the particular college and also the
website contained admin login through which theregistry of the college can check
how much minimum seats the college must have in particular branch according to
students form submission.

If a student enters his percentage and marks then this website tells according the the score and percentage probabilty of last 5 year students getting a particular branch .
And also the college admin will get to know by students form submission that if the particular student joins the college how much minimum seats must a college need.
